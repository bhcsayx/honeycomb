  Honeycomb is a system that creates signatures for network intrusion
  detection systems on traffic going in and out of a honeyd honeypot
  in real-time. It uses protocol analysis and longest-common substring
  detection techniques to recognize traffic patterns. The signatures
  can be reported in various formats, currently only a pseudo-Snort
  output is supported (pseudo because Snort doesn't support lists of
  port numbers -- shame on you). In the near future Bro will be the
  suggested signature output mode as it's much more flexible.

  To use Honeycomb, you need at least version 0.5c of honeyd. Steps to
  get Honeycomb running:

  - Make sure you have an existing installation of honeyd.

  - Make sure you have libstree installed, available at

    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cpk25/libstree-0.2.0.tar.gz

    This is the library that contains the string handling algorithms
    necessary to build Honeycomb.

  - Build the Honeycomb plugin library, using the usual
   
      ./configure [options]; make; make install

    approach. Look at ./configure --help for options,
    --enable-debugging in particular may be helpful.

  - After installation, rebuild honeyd, including honeycomb in the 
    list of plugins (i.e., pass --with-plugins=honeycomb,... plus
    any other honeyd plugins to honeyd's configure script).

  - Configure Honeycomb: look at the options in honeyd.cnf that come
    with the Honeycomb package. Add these options to your honeyd
    configuration file and adjust them as you see fit.

  - That's basically it; if you've built Honeycomb with
    --enable-debugging you should see a line like the following when
    honeyd starts up:
    
      honeycomb.c/72: Initializing Honeycomb <version>

  - Signatures are reported periodically, check the file that you
    have configured the signatures to be dumped to. By default, this
    file is /tmp/honeycomb.log.

  - Bug reports and feedback are appreciated, send them to me at the
    email address given above.
